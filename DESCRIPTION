Description: This package provides a set of tools for spatio-temporal imputation
    in R. It includes the implementation for then CUTOFF imputation method,
    a useful cross-validation function that can be used not only by the
    CUTOFF method but also by some other imputation  functions to help
    choosing an optimal value for relevant parameters, such as the number
    of k-nearest neighbors for the KNN imputation method, or the number of
    components for the SVD imputation method. It also contains tools for
    simulating data with missing values with respect to some specific
    missing pattern, for example, block missing. Some useful visualisation
    functions for imputation purposes are also provided in the package.
