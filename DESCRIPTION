Description: This package provides a set of tools for spatio-temporal imputation in R.
          It includes a new CUTOFF imputation method, a useful cross-validation method 
          working seemlessly with some other imputation functions to help them determining 
          an optimal value for their key parameters, such as the optimal number of k-nereast
          neighbors for the KNN imputation method and the optimal number of components for 
          the SVD imputation method. It also contains a set of tools for simulating 
          data with missing values with respect to some specific missing pattern. Some useful
          visulisation functions are provided.
Depends: R (>= 2.14.1), ggplot2, SpatioTemporal, DMwR, grid, missForest
