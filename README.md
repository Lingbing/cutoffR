cutoffR
======
CUTOFF is a spatio-temporal imputation method proposed by Feng et al., (2014). cutoffR is an R package that implements the CUTOFF algorithm, with additional set of tools supporting spatio-temporal cross-validation for imputation purpose, data matrix visualisation
with missing value highlighting and imputation evaluation using simulation. 

The main function is the **cutoff()** function which implements all the features proposed in Feng et al., (2014). The **Cut()** function is a simpler version that only does the basic CUTOFF imputation with limited options. WILL UPDATE SOON
